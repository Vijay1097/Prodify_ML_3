# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Task 3 (Internship Project)

This project is part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**. The main objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house based on several key features such as size, number of rooms, location, etc.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Predict housing prices using regression techniques.
- Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Train and evaluate regression models for better prediction accuracy.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

---

## 📊 Features Used

- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location
- Year built
- Other relevant property features

---

## 📈 Process Followed

1. **Data Collection** – Loaded CSV dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled null values, outliers, and duplicates.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Selected and scaled relevant features.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Visualized correlations and distributions.
5. **Model Building** – Applied Linear Regression and other models.
6. **Model Evaluation** – Used metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² score.
